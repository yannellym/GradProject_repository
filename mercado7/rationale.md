## Best algorithm selection rationale

In this scenario, Merge sort performed better than Bubble Sort. Merge sort is based on the divide and conquer method.  
By dividing the array into two equal sized parts, it can sort each one recursively. Then merge them. This made merge sort more efficient than bubble sort.
