    # 1) a) Write python code for a recursive algorithm that will calculate the number of digits in the 
    # binary expansion/representation of a positive integer n. The logic of the recursive algorithm 
    # should be something like:
    # if n = 1, the answer is 1; 
    # if n > 1, the answer is 1 more than the number of digits in the binary representation of 
    # n/2.  
    # You might want to use the python function math.floor() in your code. 
    # Your function should have only one input parameter â€“ a positive integer n. It should return the 
    # number of digits using a return statement. There should be no print statements in the function. 
    # Note: Your function is determining the number of digits in the binary expansion of n. It is not 
    # creating the binary expansion of n. 
    # Be sure to include comments identifying the input and output for this algorithm, as well as 
    # comments explaining what is accomplished by the key steps of the algorithm.
